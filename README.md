DOES NOT WORK WITH SERVERS RUN FROM NITRADO

Bot controls Ark Survival Ascended Server. Designate a specific channel for admin use only so users with
permissions to that channel can usE slash commands to start, Stop, Restart your server from discord
if needed keeping your server files safe.

This works with Server API if you use it. In ASA_The_Island_Start.bat is provided line for specifying the exe to use.

COMMANDS
    Start command: Starts server if it is not running
               
    Stop command: will safely save the world and shut down server then shut down the server monitor.

    Restart command: will first check if the server is running or not and if it is running than it will safely 
                     save the world and shut down the server, Then check for any
                     game updates and apply them if needed. Finally the server will start.

    Restart with warning command: Does what the restart command does but gives in game warnings starting at 15 minutes before
                                  the restart takes place to give players time to prepare for restart.

    Shutdown with warning command: Does what the Stop command does but gives in game warnings starting at 15 minutes before
                                   the shutdown takes place to give players time to prepare for shutdown.

    Cancel warning command: can be used to stop the restart with warning command or the shutdown with warning command so server will
                            not perform those actions.

    Wild dino wipe command: Use to destroy all wild dions on the map so new/fresh dinos can start spawning in.

SERVER MONITOR
    The server monitor is needed if you want your server to perform an auto restart each day.

    This monitors the time and when it reaches 30 minutes prior to your desired restart time it will start sending
    in game warnings to players chat so they have time to log off before world save and server restart.

    If you close the monitor your server will still run but will not perform any restart.

    If you accidently close your monitor than just run the ASA_The_Island_Start.bat again, If server is running this will not
    do anything to server it will just restart monitor and the discord bot.

EXTRA FEATURES
    Bot status displays how many players are connected to server vs max player slots available.

    Discord useres can run slash command in discord to see a list of currently connected players.

    Designate a channel for game chat. The Bot will display any in game chat that is sent in global channel to this channel.
    Discord users can chat with players in game thru this channel without being in game.

Change Notes:
	12/20/23 Added slash command for admin channel to put in any rcon command and run it from the bot to server.

	1. 	If you have not done so yet you will need to download the files from github.
	
	2. 	find the downloaded zip file and unzip it. Make sure that the files end up in a folder called, VGS_ASA_Server_Control_Bot
		if they do not than you will need to make this folder and put them into it.
		
		note:	file structure should be: VGS_ASA_Server_Control_Bot folder and in this folder should be 
				node_modules folder, rcon folder, src folder, .env file, ASA_The_Island_Start.bat File
				ASAPic.jpg file, package.json file, package-lock.json file, and README.md file.

		note: 	Your bot token should be kept safe and not shared with anyone. If it gets compromised you can Reset
				your bot token but will need to update it in you .env file for the bot.
				
	11.	Next we need the ID's for our Discord Server, Bot, and Discord Channels. So to get these we need to make sure
		developer mode is on for us in discord. Go to discord and find User Settings usually located bottom left corner
		near your personal icon and click it.
		
	12.	On the left side of User Settings scroll down until you find Advanced and click this, you should now see at the 
		top Developer Mode. Turn this on.
		
	13. Go back to your discord server and at the top left is your servers name, Right click on this and you should Now

		ASA_The_Island_Start.bat found in VGS_ASA_Server_Control_Bot folder. You should than be able to go to your
		discord and see your bot online now.
		
		If you have set everything up correctly than ASA_The_Island_Start.bat will do it all for you. It will start
		your server and your bot. It will auto update each restart and anytime the server is manually restarted.
		If for some reason your bot goes offline just start the ASA_The_Island_Start.bat again. You can run this File
		while server is running and it will not mess with the server while it is running.
